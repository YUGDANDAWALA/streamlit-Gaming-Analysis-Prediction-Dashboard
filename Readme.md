# üéÆ Esports & Gaming Analytics Dashboard (Streamlit)

A comprehensive, data-driven analytics platform for exploring the world of Esports and Casual Gaming. This project unifies competitive and mainstream gaming data, providing interactive visualizations and AI-powered behavioral insights through a modern Streamlit dashboard.

---

## üìö Project Overview

This dashboard is designed to:
- Integrate and analyze data from both Esports (competitive gaming) and Casual Gaming domains.
- Provide a unified, interactive interface for exploring trends, performance, and engagement across the gaming industry.
- Leverage machine learning to deliver personalized behavioral insights for gamers.

The project combines web-scraped Esports data, curated CSV datasets for casual/industry trends, and a machine learning model for engagement prediction, all orchestrated within a modular, Python-based architecture.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Workflow

### 1. **Data Acquisition & Ingestion**
- **Web Scraping**: `data_scraper.py` scrapes live Esports data (countries, players, tournaments, teams) from esportsearnings.com, cleaning and inserting it into a local MySQL database (`esports_data`).
- **CSV Import**: The same script also imports structured datasets for:
  - `VideoGames.csv`: Historical and best-selling video games (platform, genre, sales, etc.)
  - `Steam.csv`: Steam platform game stats (copies sold, playtime, reviews, etc.)
  - `Gaming_trends.csv`: Industry-wide trends (revenue, player base, metacritic scores, etc.)
  - `main_predict.csv`: User gaming profiles for ML engagement prediction.

### 2. **Database Design**
- All data is stored in a MySQL database (`esports_data`), with tables for each domain:
  - `countries`, `players`, `tournaments`, `teams` (Esports)
  - `VideoGames`, `SteamData`, `GamingTrends` (Casual/Industry)
- The schema is designed for efficient analytics and visualization, with numeric, categorical, and time-series fields.

### 3. **Backend & Data Access**
- **SQLAlchemy** is used for robust, Pythonic database access.
- **Streamlit Caching** ensures efficient, real-time data queries for the dashboard.
- Each dashboard section has a dedicated data-fetching function, returning preprocessed Pandas DataFrames for visualization.

### 4. **Dashboard & Visualization**
- **Streamlit App (`app.py`)**: The main entry point, orchestrating navigation, data access, and rendering.
- **Navigation**: Sidebar-driven, with four main categories:
  - **General**: Overview and Unified Data Analysis (Esports + Casual)
  - **Esports**: Countries, Players, Teams, Tournaments
  - **Casual Gamers**: VideoGames, SteamData, GamingTrends
  - **Behavioral Insights**: ML-powered engagement prediction
- **Visualizations**: Built with Plotly, including bar, line, scatter, 3D scatter, pie, and heatmap charts. Each section provides both high-level and granular views of the data.
- **Custom CSS**: Embedded for a modern, visually appealing, and responsive UI.

### 5. **Machine Learning & Behavioral Insights**
- **ML Model**: An XGBoost classifier is trained on `main_predict.csv` to predict user gaming engagement (High/Medium/Low) based on demographic and behavioral features.
- **User Interaction**: Users input their gaming profile via a form; the model predicts engagement and provides personalized feedback and suggestions.
- **ML Pipeline**: Includes label encoding, train/test split, model training, and real-time prediction within the dashboard.

## üóÇÔ∏è File-by-File Breakdown

- **`app.py`**: Main Streamlit dashboard. Handles navigation, data fetching, all visualizations, and the ML engagement prediction interface.
- **`data_scraper.py`**: Scrapes Esports data, imports CSVs, and inserts all data into the MySQL database. Contains table creation logic and data cleaning routines.
- **`setup_database.py`**: Orchestrates initial setup: checks MySQL connection, runs the scraper, and ensures all tables are created and populated.
- **`VideoGames.csv`**: Dataset of video game sales, platforms, genres, and publishers for casual gaming analytics.
- **`Steam.csv`**: Steam platform dataset with game sales, playtime, reviews, and developer/publisher info.
- **`Gaming_trends.csv`**: Industry trends dataset, including revenue, player base, metacritic scores, and trending status.
- **`main_predict.csv`**: User gaming profiles for training and running the ML engagement prediction model.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies (Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, XGBoost, etc.).
